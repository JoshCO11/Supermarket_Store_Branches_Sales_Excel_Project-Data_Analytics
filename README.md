# Supermarket Store Branches Sales Excel Project - Data Analytics

### **ABOUT THE PROJECT**  

This is my first data analysis project using Microsoft Excel. In here I have used the dataset from Kaggle: Supermarket Store Branches Sales <br>[Click the Kaggle link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/stores-area-and-sales-data)

I have decided to create this project to become my first-ever built project for my Data Analyst journey. I exhibited here my newly attained Microsoft Excel knowledge. This first project will serve as my strong foundation, as I will look back at this again and again to check my progress in my journey.

To further observe what Excel skills I have unlocked I asked ChatGPT to formulate questions about my dataset.<br>
Here are the generated questions:

> **Performance Analysis**:
> 1. Which store generates the highest and lowest sales? 
> 2. What is the average store sales across all stores? 
>
> **Customer Behavior**:
> 1. Is there a correlation between daily customer count and store sales? 
> 2. How does the number of items available affect 
>    the daily customer count or store sales? 
>
> **Store Characteristics**:
> 1. Does store area influence the daily customer count or store sales? 
> 2. Which stores have the highest efficiency (sales per square foot)? 
>
> **Trends and Patterns**:
> 1. Are larger stores consistently associated with higher 
>    sales or customer traffic? 
>
> **Segmentation**:
> 1. Can stores be grouped into high-performing, average, and 
>    low-performing categories based on sales or customer count? 
>
> **Optimization**:
> 1. What store characteristics (e.g., size, items available) maximize sales or 
>    customer count? 
> 2. Could specific changes (e.g., increasing store area or inventory) improve performance for 
>    underperforming stores?

### **DATASET INFORMATION** 
Let's first examine the columns in my dataset:<br>
#### **Dataset Columns**  
- **Store ID**: This serves as identification of the stores.  
- **Store_Area**: Physical area of the store in square yards.  
- **Items_Available**: Number of different items available in the corresponding store.  
- **Daily_Customer_Count**: Average number of customers who visited the stores over a month.  
- **Store_Sales**: Sales (in US $) that the stores made.

The dataset also has a total number of 897 rows.


### **SOLVING THE *PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS* QUESTIONS**
The first question is: ***Which store generates the highest and lowest sales?***<br>
The second question is: ***What is the average store sales across all stores?***<br>
For this *Performance Analysis* questions, I made a table with three columns and rows.<br>
- Column 1 is Metric (Highest Sales, Lowest Sales, Average Store Sales)<br>
- Column 2 is Store ID (To identify which store holds the highest or lowest sales.)
- Column 3 is Sales (Putting the amount of revenue collected by that store.)

Here is the image of the table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/7d6883e0c3e667e5b2a11284fd37ea8895735365/images/Question%201/Performance_Analysis_1.PNG" alt=" Performance Analysis #1" width="800"
</p>

What I did here was search for the highest and lowest sales first and align them in the rows under the *Sales* column.<br>
The formulas that I used are the following:<br>
For the highest sales:
```
=MAX(Table1[Store_Sales])
```
For the lowest sales:
```
=MIN(Table1[Store_Sales])
```
In finding the average store sales, I used the median formula instead of average to avoid the impact of outliers.
```
=MEDIAN(Table1[Store_Sales])
```

After identifying the sales, I now started looking for the Store ID. The formula that I used is as following:<br>
This formula is to find the Store ID with the highest sales:
```
=INDEX(Table1[[Store ID ]], MATCH(MAX(Table1[Store_Sales]), Table1[Store_Sales], 0))
```
This formula is to find the Store ID with the lowest sales:
```
=INDEX(Table1[[Store ID ]], MATCH(MIN(Table1[Store_Sales]), Table1[Store_Sales], 0))
```

That is how I answered the questions in ***Performance Analysis***.<br>
Let's now move into the second set of questions. 


### **SOLVING THE *CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR* QUESTIONS**
The first question is: ***Is there a correlation between daily customer count and store sales?***

In this part, I needed to determine if there is a relationship between the two features. So I used the correlation formula in Excel. I've also used the Data Analysis Toolpak to gather more information about the relationship between the two features. Additionally, I created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.

The formula for finding correlation in Excel is:
```
=CORREL(Table1[Daily_Customer_Count], Table1[Store_Sales])
```
To further understand the relationship here is the regression analysis:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/e20ff4e5ee8b5f0bfde5dc41fa409b6bf68c2d17/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr1.1.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #1.1" width="800"
</p>

What's important to understand in this complex set of numbers are the Multiple R, R Square, Significance F, Coefficients, Intercept, X-Variable, and P-value. These can accessed using Data Analysis Toolpak in Excel. 

- **Multiple R** is just the same as the ***=CORR*** formula in Excel.
- **R Sqaure** is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, also known as the coefficient of determination.
- **Significance F** is the overall significance of the independent variable to dependent variable. If the result is below 0.05 that means its a good model.
- **Coefficients** is the estimated values of the regression equation that quantify the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
- **Intercept** is the representation predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero.
- **P-value** When the value is less than ***0.05*** that means the coefficient is working and you should disregard the null hypothesis.
- **X Variable** is the independent variable. You can put the name of the column here when you included the label header in your list.

As you can see in this image, the Multiple R is low, conveying low relationship between the two variables. The Significance F is about ***.80***, meaning it is not working well. Then for P-value the intercept value is less than ***0.05***, which means it is good. While the X Variable is much higher also almost at ***.80*** indicating no relationship, supporting the null hypothesis.

Some people understand it better when presented visually, so here is the scatter plot:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/e20ff4e5ee8b5f0bfde5dc41fa409b6bf68c2d17/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr1.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #1" width="800"
</p>

The almost flat trendline indicates that there is no correlation between the Daily Customer Count and Store Sales. Probably that is because the people entering and exiting the store may not be making purchases, possibly they only goes inside for window shopping. Additionally, the store might be themed for seasonal events, such as Christmas, Halloween, etc., where customers doesn't necessarily buy items that can be used in regular days.

Now, let's dive deeper into the analysis by answering the second question: ***How does the number of items available affect the daily customer count or store sales?***

In this part, I followed the same process as in the first question, the only difference is the feature used. 

First, I checked the correlation between the number of items and daily customer count using the formula:
```
=CORREL(Table1[Items_Available], Table1[Daily_Customer_Count])
```

Here is the regression analysis:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/e20ff4e5ee8b5f0bfde5dc41fa409b6bf68c2d17/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr2.1.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #2.1" width="800"
</p>

It shows low Multiple R, suggesting no correlation. The Significance F is again greater than ***0.05***. The intercept's p-value is the only factor that rejects the null hypothesis, as the independent variable has a significance of ***0.22***, greater than 0.05 and indicates a weak correlation.

Here is the scatter plot visualization:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/51193e1245b3cf39635aadf47e77a16a49f720a7/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr_Problem2.1.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #2" width="800"
</p>

The low correlation relationship between the number of items available and the daily customer count maybe due to poor desicion-making by the store owner in ordering stocks that doesn't sell well at that particular location. Customers might be looking for specific items that arenâ€™t available in the store. Another example could be seasonal stores, which are not visited often outside of the holiday season.. 

Here is the correlation between the number of items and store sales.<br>
Correlation using the formula:
```
=CORREL(Table1[Items_Available], Table1[Daily_Customer_Count])
```
Here is the regression analysis:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/51193e1245b3cf39635aadf47e77a16a49f720a7/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr2.2.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #2.2" width="800"
</p>

It also shows low Multiple R, suggesting no correlation. However, the Significance F is under 0.05, suggesting a good model. Also, both intercept and independent value is under 0.05, showing that they are statistically significant.

Here is the visual of scatter plot between number of items available and store sales:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/51193e1245b3cf39635aadf47e77a16a49f720a7/images/Question%202/Customer_Behavior_Corr_Problem2.2.PNG" alt=" Customer Behavior #2.2" width="800"
</p>

The visualization shows a trendline with a slight upward slope, which is due to the positive Significance F, indicating a good model. However, it is also almost flat, indicating low to no correlation between the two features. 

Does this mean the store is performing poorly because the number of items available shows little correlation with sales? The answer is no. This could be because the store may not be relevant to people around the area or customers on regular days. As I mentioned earlier, the store might be focused on seasonal events, and people donâ€™t often purchase items outside those times. Another possible reason is a mismatch between demand and supply. Customers might not buy products due to their quality, suggesting that poor decision-making in restocking excessive quantities, rather than focusing on quality, could lead to low correlation. Highlighting to avoid overstocking and monitor the store's product performance to avoid wasted cost. 


Now that we've addressed the second set of questions, let's move on to the third set.

### **SOLVING THE *STORE CHARACTERISTICS* QUESTIONS**

The first question is: ***Does store area influence the daily customer count or store sales?***

What I did here was I also answered it by using the *=CORR* formula in Excel and then I created a scatter plot with a trendline to be able to better understand the relationship visually.

I analyzed Store Area and Daily Customer Count relationship:
```
=CORREL(Table1[Store_Area],Table1[Daily_Customer_Count])
```
The result is ***-0.04*** indicating a negative correlation. This is not a favorable outcome because it means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. You can visualize this more clearly in the image below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/c6f84fe64d3687e855e02d23de6e0b21bd193f04/images/Question%203/Store_Characteristics_1.PNG" alt="Store Characteristics #1" width="800"
</p>

In this visualization, we can see that as the Store Area increases, the Daily Customer Count decreases. This is evident from the downward slope. While the decline is noticeable, it still suggests that they are not strongly correlated and do not have a strong relationship with each other. There could be several reasons for this. 

First reason might be that the store doesn't attract regular, day-to-day customers. The items for sale could be too expensive for everyday shoppers, which might explain why the store is large. Another reason could be, the store has a limited selection of items. This ties back to the first reason, as probably the items are targeted at a specific demographics. Leading to mismatching of target customers in the location area.

Now, let's analyze the correlation between Store Area and Store Sales. I followed the same process here using the formula
```
=CORREL(Table1[Store_Area],Table1[Store_Sales])
```
It's also low but this time it's not negative. Let's check the scatter plot.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/c6f84fe64d3687e855e02d23de6e0b21bd193f04/images/Question%203/Store_Characteristics_1.1.PNG" alt="Store Characteristics #1.1" width="800"
</p>

The slope here is not downward; it's actually upward, indicating a positive relationship. As you can see, most of the stores around ***1,200 to 1,800*** size and with the store sales about ***$40,000 and $80,000***. To answer the question, does store area influence store sales? The answer is somewhat yes. This is probably, larger stores are offering more expensive items. These expensive items could be branded items that you cannot find in your local stores. Another reason is that larger stores offer more than selling products. Larger stores can offer satisfaction like play areas for children or other areas that could make the customer relaxed. Additionally, larger stores may have more effective marketing strategies that encourage customers to make purchases rather than just browsing.. 


That covers the first question in Store Characteristics. Let's now move on to the second question: ***Which stores have the highest efficiency (sales per square foot)?***

For this part, I decided to use a pivot table to easily filter and create a chart. I created a simple table to include Store ID and the efficiency of each store. To be able to answer this question, I needed to create another column to my dataset, called ***"Efficiency of (Sales per Square Foot)"***. This column calculates the efficiency of each store based on sales per square foot. To do this, I first converted the square yards to square feet by multiplying the yard square value by 9.

Here is the formula:
```
[Store_Area]]*9
```

To find the efficiency, I divided the store sales by the square footage of the store area. Here is the formula:
```
=[@[Store_Sales]]/([@[Store_Area]]*9)
```
Now that we have the new column, we can now insert a pivot table. In the pivot table, I selected the Store ID as rows and Efficiency of (Sales per Square Foot) as the values. Then I filtered the Efficiency of (Sales per Square Foot) by largest to smallest. Finally, I filtered the Store ID to show only top 10 because 897 rows would be too many.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/c6f84fe64d3687e855e02d23de6e0b21bd193f04/images/Question%203/Store_Characteristics_2.1.PNG" alt="Store Characteristics #2.1" width="800"
</p>

Here is now the pivot table. After that, I've inserted a pivot chart, specifically a clustered column chart to visualize the results.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/c6f84fe64d3687e855e02d23de6e0b21bd193f04/images/Question%203/Store_Characteristics_2.PNG" alt="Store Characteristics #2" width="800"
</p>

As you can see, the highest efficiency is $10.70 USD and the lowest efficiency is at $1.23 USD. This means the Store ID 557 is earning $10.70 USD per square foot of store space. This could be a result of effective store layout, where the products are strategically placed to be easily visible to customers, helping them find what they need quickly. Not giving the customer a hard time finding the product he or she needs. Another possibility is that the store attracts a high volume of customers, thus maximizing the use of the store area. Another reason could be, it has a great marketing strategy in promoting the products inside. It could be also because of the excellent customer service inside the store.


So those are the analysis answer for the third set of questions. Let's now move to the fourth set of questions.

### **SOLVING THE *TRENDS AND PATTERNS* QUESTIONS**

The only question in this is: ***Are larger stores consistently associated with higher sales or customer traffic?***

In this part, I first checked if there are any outliers in the Store Area. To do this, I gathered the basic statistics description of the Store Area.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/53412f6283ecdd8f25e5d229f8514ef22cc9c48c/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1" width="800"
</p>

I can see here that the average is slightly higher than the median by a small margin. This suggests that the distribution of store area is likely right-skewed. I also created a visualization to make it easier to understand. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/53412f6283ecdd8f25e5d229f8514ef22cc9c48c/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.1.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1.1" width="800"
</p>

As I mentioned earlier, the difference between the average and the median is very small, because of that the visualization of the chart does not show a right-skewed distribution but rather resembles a perfect bell curve. This chart led me to continue my analysis without the further need to clean or remove outliers in the dataset.<br><br>
Next, I proceeded to answer the question of whether there is an associated relationship between larger stores and higher sales. To address this, I needed to set a threshold for distinguishing larger stores. For that, I used ***1 Standard Deviation above the Mean***. <br><br>
The formula to achieve this is:
```
=median + standard deviation
```
I was able to do this because I displayed the store area description, where I was able to check all the nessecesary information about the store area.

After determining the threshold for larger stores, I began discretizing the store areas that are greater than or equal to the threshold. Here are the results:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/8ab35e59bd5a426011a24eed0d5abe8605b36483/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_L_SA_bin.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns Large Store Area bin" width="800"
</p>

With that, I was able to create this plot showing whether larger stores contribute to higher store sales.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/8ab35e59bd5a426011a24eed0d5abe8605b36483/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.2.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1.2" width="800"
</p>

As you can see in this visualization, as the store size increases, the total sales tend to decrease. This could be because larger stores are not effectively displaying their products to customers. There is also a chance that probably the store is not in a good area for their target customers. Maybe their marketing strategies are not convincing enough to drive sales. Itâ€™s important to note that a larger store area doesn't necessarily equate to higher profits. So, what about the stores with a store area smaller than the threshold?

Here is the plot of that:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/8ab35e59bd5a426011a24eed0d5abe8605b36483/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.3.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1.3" width="800"
</p>

This analysis wasn't part of the original question about stores with areas smaller than the threshold, but I included it for better understanding of whether store size is truly relevant. Well, according to the image, we can observe that smaller stores see a rise in sales up to a size range of around ***1,455 - 1,494*** square feet, suggesting that stores in this range are generating significantly higher sales than larger stores. Also, as you can see, many smaller stores are outperforming larger ones in terms of total sales. What could be the reason behind this? One possibility is that these smaller stores have an effective strategy for selling products to a targeted mass market. The store owner probably aware of what products are in-demand in his or her area. Providing those items for sale to the mass of customers. Another reason could be that these stores are in the right location for their products. For instance, a scuba diving or beach store located near the beach would attract many customers, as it is the most convenient place for beachgoers to shop, which could explain why it generates higher sales compared to larger stores.

I've also analyzed the association between the larger store area and daily customer count. For this, I used the discretized bins for larger store areas and visualized the data in a chart.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/8ab35e59bd5a426011a24eed0d5abe8605b36483/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.4.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1.4" width="800"
</p>

Similar to the relationship between large store area and store sales, we observe a decline in daily customer count as the store area increases. This could be because larger stores often sell more expensive items that cater to a specific demographic, which may not align with the broader population in the surrounding area. As a result, these stores may attract fewer customers. The negative correlation value further supports this observation, indicating that as store area increases, the daily customer count tends to decrease, which aligns with the pattern I've mentioned.

Now, letâ€™s examine the stores with areas smaller than the threshold for larger stores. What can we infer from this group?

Here is the chart for that:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/38861ed45fc891237a9c287ea9462fd3a2eb2107/images/Question%204/Trends_and_Patterns_1.5.PNG" alt="Trends and Patterns 1.5" width="800"
</p>

Just like the relationship between store area and store sales, we see a rise in daily customer traffic for smaller to medium-sized stores, peaking around store areas between ***1,415 - 1,454*** square feet, before experiencing a decline. What's the reason behind the larger traction of daily customer traffic than the larger store area? One reason is that smaller or medium-sized stores tend to sell products that are highly in demand within their specific location. The store's proximity and accessibility make it easier for customers to visit, which could explain the higher traffic. Another reason is that, probably the store is selling products in much more affordable prices. This is a stragety by pricing items lower, these stores may attract more customers who are looking for budget-friendly options, resulting in higher sales volume even if the individual profit margin is lower. If that's the case the customer traffic will be high because not all customers can afford expensive products, so more affordable stores might appeal to a larger customer base. Additionally, the correlation between store size (less than the threshold for large stores) and daily customer count is negative, suggesting that whenever the other variable goes to increase the other one will decrease. That is probably why once the store size reaches the peak range of ***1,415 - 1,454*** square feet, the customer traffic begins to decrease.

That is all for the set of fourth set of question about the trends and patterns. Let's now go to segmentation.

### **SOLVING THE *SEGMENTATION* QUESTIONS**

There is only one question in this set, that is: *Can stores be grouped into high-performing, average, and low-performing categories based on sales or customer count?*

I've assessed both the grouping on store sales and daily customer count. Here are the basic description of both store sales and daily customer count:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/c0404f97d8c15dfb2c20514c7bd1870b88deff4f/images/Question%205/Segmentation_1.PNG" alt="Segmentation 1" width="800"
</p>

I've used this basic description to create two new column to my dataset page. The two columns are *Sales Performance Category* and *Customer Count Performance Category*. In this two new column I've used an Excel formula *=IFS* to distinguish whatever store category its fall to. The average category is the median, low-performaning is the stores less than 25th percentile, and high-performing is the stores greater than 75th percentile.

The exact formula is here.<br>
This is for the store sales category:
```
=IFS([@[Store_Sales]] < Segmentation!$C$4, "Low -performing", AND([@[Store_Sales]] >= Segmentation!$C$4, [@[Store_Sales]] <= Segmentation!$C$6), "Average", [@[Store_Sales]] > Segmentation!$C$6, "High-performing")
```

This is for the daily customer count category:
```
=IFS([@[Daily_Customer_Count]] < Segmentation!$F$4, "Low -performing", AND([@[Daily_Customer_Count]] >= Segmentation!$F$4, [@[Daily_Customer_Count]] <= Segmentation!$F$6), "Average", [@[Daily_Customer_Count]] > Segmentation!$F$6, "High-performing")
```
After that I've created a pie chart and column chart to visualize the category for both store sales and daily customer count.

This plots is for Store Sales category:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/f3d8f2fe76077698edfdfc167746a2b0fa540613/images/Question%205/Segmentation_2.PNG" alt="Segmentation 2" width="800"
</p>

As you can see there is more average store sales than both low-performing and high-performing stores. This shows that in our dataset, it is more on about average stores.


This plot is for Daily Customer Count category:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/f3d8f2fe76077698edfdfc167746a2b0fa540613/images/Question%205/Segmentation_3.PNG" alt="Segmentation 3" width="800"
</p>

For the daily customer count, the average is still the highest at *459* stores, while the high-performing is at *217* and for low-performing is at *220*. Indicating that, when it comes to daily customer count in our dataset, it is more on about the average range of values.


Now, we've finished the fifth set of questions. We will now move to the final question, which is *"Optimization"*.

### **SOLVING THE *OPTIMIZATION* QUESTIONS**

The first question is: *What store characteristics (e.g., size, items available) maximize sales or customer count?*

In this question I've created a correlation table where it shows the correlation of each feature to each other. Here is the table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/JoshCO11/Supermarket_Store_Branches_Sales_Excel_Project-Data_Analytics/blob/ed48dfc4dbe19fe649323bc0bb12f381de3da459/images/Question%206/Optimization_1.PNG" alt="Optimization 1" width="800"
</p>

As you can see there is no correlation that is high other than the equal feature or the same feature, and the feature of *Area * Items* which I have created just to check if it will put affect to the store sales, but as you can see it only has *0.102* correlation with store sales, which is pretty low. Why is this the result? The possible reason is that, the dataset doesn't include more important features. Remember this dataset is from kaggle, so this dataset is probably missing some columns but still, this dataset has a 700+ upvotes, so it's still a good dataset for project.

Now let's proceed to the last and second question in this final set of question: *Could specific changes (e.g., increasing store area or inventory) improve performance for underperforming stores?*

In this part what I did is I've added numerous new columns to my dataset to simulate an increase to the store area, items available, and daily customer count. They are increased by 50% and 100%. The formula I've used is this. By the way, the dataset I've used here are the only low-performing stores, and we've already covered that in the previous set of questions, so I've used it. 

For 50% raise:
```
=Column_Feature * 1.5
```

For 100% raise:
```
=Column_Feature * 2
```

After that I've used multiple regression analysis to finally simulate the increase to the store sales. Here is the result of the multiple regression analysis:

</p>

I've disregard other values in the multiple regression analysis because the only thing I will use is this one, the values you can see in the image. 

After that I've created another set of new columns to present the store sales of the increased variables. The formula I used is this:
```
=Intercept + (Coefficient_1 * Variable_1) + (Coefficient_2 * Variable_2) + (Coefficient_3 * Increased_Variable_3)
```

This formula depends on what I'm simulating, for this example, let's say I'm increasing the *variable 3* that is why I've used the increased variable instead the original. The rest will be the original when you only want to check the simulated increase of that one variable.

After doing this in each new columns, I've created a table and also bar chart to understand if something really significant happens whenever there are changes with the present features in the dataset. Whether will it really increase the store sales or not. 

This is the table:

</p>

In this table you will see the changes, and I made it easier to understand because of the column of percentage changes. The only thing that increased here is the correlation between the store area and store sales. The rest is at negative. What is the meaning of that? before we answer that question, here are the bar charts:

Well, as you can see here there was a huge leap of store sales when the store area increased in the underperforming stores. This might probably because of enhanced/better storage capacity, making the stocks more and when people comes they are able to give what the customers are looking. Another reason is better display of products inside the store. They might also had an edge to their competitors because they've had an upgrade of store size, gaining attraction the customers around their area. This means that whenever the underperforming stores decided to increase their store size about *50% or 100%*5, the store sales will increase in significant in about *41% or 81%*.

When it comes to the simulation of increasing the items available, there is a huge decrease to the total sales. The store sales decreases by *39% or 79%*, when you increase the items avaialable by *50% or 100%*. This is probably because the items added only costed the store and did not get the return of costs. This is probably because of poor decision making of restocking items that is not selling good in their location. Another reason is the location, the area probably not crowded with people.

Lastly is when the simulated increase of daily customer count. This simulation also had a decrease to the total sales. When the daily customer count increased by *50%* the change of total sales dropped by *1%*. Then when the daily customer count increased by *100%* the total sales dropped by *2%*, so what is the meaning of this? This is probably the customers just stopped over the store, so even they count as addition to the daily count customer, the sales doesn't increased because the customers did not buy anything. They just did some window shopping or used the store as waiting location to someone. Another reason is that, people may tend to go inside the store to buy something not that significant to the overall total revenue of the store. For example buying a penny priced item, will not contribute a lot to the total sales. Another reason is the poor marketing strategy of the store. The customer service is probably also poor. The display of product is also probably poor, giving the customers hard time to buy whenever tons of customers come daily. 


That is the last set of answers to my analysis project.<br>

What I've learned from the analysis? I can say that the independent variables of the dataset does not affect the store sales (dependent variable) in a lot of ways. Maybe other aspects affect it more and it's not included in the dataset that was presented. But other than that, I can say that there is chance for underperforming stores to gain more sales. That is by increasing their store area. Investing to the quality of the store will get them more earnings than improving their marketing strategy to attract more traction of customers in daily basis. Also to avoid the overstocking of items. The owner should always check and be aware to the demand-supply situation of his or her store. Aiming to restock more items that is relevant to the store instead of ordering unnecessary items. 


### **CONCLUSION ABOUT THE PROJECT**  

This is my first project on data analysis using Excel. The skills I've showcased is just a the surface level of what a real data analyst can do, but this will serve as a stepping stone to improve my analytical skills in the future. I would appreciate hearing your reactions and comments on my analysisâ€”whether positive or constructive criticism, both will help me progress. I also plan to upload more projects here related to data using SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and other data-related tools
